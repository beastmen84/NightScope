# NSOM Backend Migration Status Audit

## Executive Summary

This developer-only audit reviews the current NSOM backend migration state after the Planner, Home `recommendedDeepSky`, Best Object, Advanced Observing backend, Sky Compass and Detail/Object default-on steps. It does not change runtime behaviour, QML, scoring, logging, network access or runtime file writes.

## Readiness Verdict

- Verdict: `backend_nsom_default_on_surfaces_closed`.
- Current default-on surfaces closed: `True`.
- Ready to start next backend area: `True`.
- Ready for visible UI redesign: `False`.
- Runtime behaviour changed by this audit: `False`.
- Recommended next step: Review 1.12.2 ObserverCapability adapter extraction, then decide the next backend area.
- Reason: Planner, Home recommendedDeepSky, Best Object, Advanced Observing backend, Sky Compass and Detail/Object have default-on NSOM paths with explicit rollback. Remaining items are non-blocking legacy or hybrid surfaces; Sky Map has been removed as dead legacy and Equipment now has a shared ObserverCapability/Q_target adapter while runtime setup recommendations remain unchanged.

## Audit Blockers

- none

## Default-On NSOM Surfaces

| Surface | Status | Default flag | Rollback | NSOM role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planner | `default_on_closed` | `NSOM_PLANNER_SCORING_ENABLED = True` | `NightPlannerService(use_nsom_planner_scoring=False)` | ObservationOpportunity ranking |
| Home recommendedDeepSky | `default_on_closed` | `NSOM_HOME_RECOMMENDED_DEEP_SKY_ENABLED = True` | `AppController(use_nsom_home_recommended_deep_sky=False)` | ObservableTargetValue ordering |
| Best Object | `default_on_closed` | `NSOM_BEST_OBJECT_ENABLED = True` | `AppController(use_nsom_best_object=False)` | Home-specific ObservationOpportunity selection |
| Advanced Observing backend | `default_on_closed_backend_only` | `NSOM_ADVANCED_OBSERVING_ENABLED = True` | `AppController(use_nsom_advanced_observing=False)` | category ObservableTargetValue projection |
| Sky Compass | `default_on_closed` | `NSOM_SKY_COMPASS_ENABLED = True` | `AppController(use_nsom_sky_compass=False)` | ObservableTargetValue based direction policy |
| Detail/Object internal payload | `default_on_closed_backend_only` | `NSOM_DETAIL_OBJECT_ENABLED = True` | `AppController(use_nsom_detail_object=False)` | separate internal Detail/Object payload |

## Remaining Legacy Or Hybrid Surfaces

| Area | Status | Why it remains | Recommended handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Equipment recommendations | `observer_adapter_extracted` | `EquipmentService` still ranks eyepiece/Barlow/binocular candidates with its own practical configuration score. `observer_capability_adapter.py` now provides shared ObserverCapability/Q_target projection while `docs/EQUIPMENT_NSOM_POLICY_READINESS.md` keeps runtime setup recommendations unchanged. | Review the adapter extraction, then choose either ObservationConditions read-model cleanup or Equipment presenter contract work. |
| ObservationConditions prepared-object cache | `hybrid_conditioned_objects` | `ObservationConditionsService` still creates conditioned object copies for moon and light-pollution presentation/fallback paths. | Defer broad cleanup until an ObservationSnapshot/read-model boundary exists. |
| Notifications | `legacy_compatible_consumer_contract` | `NotificationService` consumes legacy-compatible best object, plan and advanced-score payloads rather than NSOM explanations. | Leave stable until notification-specific NSOM semantics are defined. |
| Catalogue / raw object score | `upstream_legacy_input` | Catalogue and engine prepared scores remain the raw target input for several compatibility payloads. | Treat as Universe/read-model work, not as a ranking hotfix. |

## Recommended Sequence

- `Review 1.9.7`: Verify this backend status audit before opening a new migration area.
- `Review 1.10.6`: Verify Detail/Object NSOM migration closeout documentation.
- `1.11.0 Legacy backend surface audit`: Classify remaining legacy paths as dead code, temporary rollback or payload compatibility.
- `Review 1.11.1`: Confirm the Sky Map controller/property/service path is removed cleanly.
- `1.12.0 Equipment/ObserverCapability NSOM comparison`: Start the next active backend NSOM area with Equipment recommendation comparison.
- `Review 1.12.0`: Confirm the comparison report is accurate and no runtime Equipment behaviour changed.
- `1.12.1 Equipment NSOM policy readiness`: Decide whether Equipment should get a default-off NSOM path or stay a practical setup helper.
- `Review 1.12.1`: Confirm the Equipment policy decision defers runtime replacement and preserves behaviour.
- `1.12.2 ObserverCapability adapter extraction`: Extract a shared ObserverCapability/Q_target adapter while leaving EquipmentService runtime output unchanged.
- `Review 1.12.2`: Confirm adapter extraction preserved Equipment comparison values and runtime output.
- `Next backend area decision`: Choose between ObservationConditions read-model cleanup and Equipment presenter contract work.
- `Later UI explanation work`: Expose NSOM rationale only in a dedicated UX step after backend semantics are stable.

## Conclusion

The backend NSOM migration is closed for the already migrated recommendation surfaces and Detail/Object. Sky Map has been removed as dead legacy rather than migrated to NSOM. Equipment now has a shared ObserverCapability/Q_target adapter while runtime setup recommendations remain unchanged. The next backend step should be chosen explicitly; visible UI explanation work remains separate.
